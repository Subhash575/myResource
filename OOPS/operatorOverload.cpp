in C++, Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. It is an idea of giving special meaning to an existing operator in C++ without changing its original meaning.

In this article, we will further discuss about operator overloading in C++ with examples and see which operators we can or cannot overload in C++.

C++ Operator Overloading
// C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +. Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Numbers, Fractional Numbers, Big integers, etc.

// C++ Program to Demonstrate the
// working/Logic behind Operator
// Overloading
class A {
    statements;
};

int main()
{
    A a1, a2, a3;

    a3 = a1 + a2;

    return 0;
}

In this example, we have 3 variables “a1”, “a2” and “a3” of type “class A”. Here we are trying to add two objects “a1” and “a2”, which are of user-defined type i.e. of type “class A” using the “+” operator. This is not allowed, because the addition operator “+” is predefined to operate only on built-in data types. But here, “class A” is a user-defined type, so the compiler generates an error. This is where the concept of “Operator overloading” comes in.

Now, if the user wants to make the operator “+” add two class objects, the user has to redefine the meaning of the “+” operator such that it adds two class objects. This is done by using the concept of “Operator overloading”. So the main idea behind “Operator overloading” is to use C++ operators with class variables or class objects. Redefining the meaning of operators really does not change their original meaning; instead, they have been given additional meaning along with their existing ones.
